## Motivation

Nowadays, it is possible to send encrypted or plain text messages to other accounts only. When community members want to share
information, for example important announcements about software updates, other communication channels, mostly discord, reddit, 
and/or twitter are used. This is, because there is no way to publicly broadcast information within the blockchain, such this
can be visualized/accessed _natively_, e.g. in a wallet. 

The broadcasting feature allows account subscriptions and make it easier to inform other users about important information 
and ongoing activities in the Burst ecosystem.
 
## Abstract

Any user with a Burst Account is able to broadcast an (unencrypted) message without specifying a recipient. This message 
can be accessed through a new API command. To avoid abuse (spamming) broadcasting is allowed only twice a day and with a higher fee. 

## Specification

To broadcast a message two new API methods need to be implemented. One for sending a message without a recipient and one for 
getting the broadcasted message by account. 

### Avoid Spamming

To avoid abuse two mechanisms are suggested. 

1. Broadcasting is time-limited, i.e. 1 broadcast per account every 12 hours
2. A broadcasted messages should be feed with 10 Burst


### broadcastMessage

Broadcasting a message is similar to `sendMessage`, but without specifying a recipient and a fee, as the latter is fixed.

`<host>/burst?requestType=broadcastMessage&deadline=24&message=This%20is%20an%20announcement%20example`

The HTTP method is `POST`. The response is almost identical with [`sendMessage`](https://burstwiki.org/wiki/The_Burst_API_Examples#Send_Message)


#### Implementation Details 

- A broadcasted Message should be marked with __transaction type 1__ (`TYPE_MESSAGING`) and a new __subtype 2__(?) `SUBTYPE_MESSAGING_BROADCASTED_MESSAGE`

- Due to the suggested time limitation, a denied POST should return a clear error message, e.g. `Daily broadcast limit reached`

### getBroadcastedMessages

Although, it is possible already to get broadcasted messages with [`getAccountTransactions`](https://burstwiki.org/wiki/The_Burst_API_Examples#Get_Account_Transactions)
using the senders account id and the aforementioned type and subtype, a more convenient method should be introduced

`<host>/burst?requestType=getBroadcastedMessages&account=12345678`

The HTTP method is `GET`. The response is almost identical with [`getAccountTransactions`](https://burstwiki.org/wiki/The_Burst_API_Examples#Get_Account_Transactions)

> As this method would wrap the `getAccountTransactions` implementation the same filter parameters, i.e. `firstIndex`, `lastIndex` can be reused

## Compatibility

The change won't have any impact on current versions.
