## Introduction
Most platforms use smart contracts to handle token creation and serve various activities like buying, selling, and transferring from within the smart contract. 
Signum’s approach is different. On the Signum blockchain, tokens are situated similarly to the blockchain’s own native coin (Signa) in that they are unique entities that can be transferred or traded directly between accounts.
Their position is directly attached to accounts, not taken via a smart contract. 

All possible activities are governed by the blockchain nodes’ existing transaction types and logic, making the current token setup “smart”, even though we need to add additional transactions and logic to refine it for a true “smart token” setup.

## Motivation
In 2014, Signum introduced its unique token functionality with the genesis block.  Since that time, not much development has taken place in this particular area of the blockchain.  Surprisingly, when we compare the current features of ERC-20/BEP-20 contracts with the existing Signum setup, we see that our original setup was already forward-looking.
